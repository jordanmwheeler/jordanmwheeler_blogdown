I am a Quantitative Methodology graduate student at the University of Georgia in the Education Psychology Department.

I am the recipient of the College of Education's Research Scholar Award. I work as a graduate assistant for the Georgia Center of Assessment where I focus my research on topic modeling and text analysis.

Previously, I was a graduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha where I earned my Master of Science in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics. As partial fulfillment for my masters, I developed an application which pulled current stock data for any stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange data, via a Yahoo API, and modeled the data using an ARMA + GARCH time series model. A grid search method was used to automate and optimize the parameters of the ARMA + GARCH model.

I also worked as a statistician for a consulting company where I developed predictive models for clients in different industries.
