I am a <a href="https://coe.uga.edu/directory/quantitative-methodology-program" target="_blank">Quantitative Methodology</a> graduate student at the <a href="https://www.uga.edu/" target="_blank">University of Georgia</a> in the <a href="https://coe.uga.edu/directory/educational-psychology" target="_blank">Education Psychology Department</a>.

I am the recipient of the College of Education's Research Scholar Award, which allows me to be a graduate research assistant at the <a href="http://gca.coe.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Center of Assessment</a>, where my research focuses on topic modeling.

Previously, I was a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska Omaha</a> where I received a master's degree in <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/mathematics/index.php" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> with a concentration in <a href="https://catalog.unomaha.edu/graduate/degree-programs-certificates-minors/mathematics/mathematics-ms/#header" target="_blank">Statistics</a>. As partial fulfillment for my degree, I developed an <a href="https://jordanmwheeler.com/work/shinyapps/ForecastApp/" target="_blank">application</a> which pulls current stock data for any stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange and models the data using an ARMA + GARCH time series model. A grid search method automates and optimizes the parameters of the ARMA + GARCH model.

While pursuing my master's degree, I worked as statistician for a consulting company, <a href="https://catchintelligence.com/" target="_blank">CATCH Intelligence</a>. Here, I used R, Python, and SAP Predictive Analytics to develop and implement predictive models for clients throughout different industries, such as: energy companies, state government departments, and other private companies. I would present methods, implementation, and results through slide deck presentations and documentation.
